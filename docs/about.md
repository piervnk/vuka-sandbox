to be done

### precis from DR Kat

where can  VUKA SA can make the most difference.
 
1. information overload and splintering - everywhere. 
2. Everyone wants to be heard. 
3. people are frustrated and feel helpless.  
4. people do not read. lots of duplication.
5. no ONE place that reports ALL that is happening, in lay peoples terms, after verifying the correct story on a regular basis.(side note from chris - this is impossible and the internet was invented to fix this problem. strangely difficult. see point 1 and 4)
6.  no CENTRAL HUB where people can ask a question and be directed to the right place for help and/or clarity. 

make a difference - change the narrative -- TOGETHER 

VUKA SA VISION & GOALS

Short term vision and goals
 • Build a network and a data base of projects that are currently happening around the country. Engage with reps from these projects and groups and collaborate 
 ⁃ Education and outreach program 
 ⁃ Health and Healing
 ⁃ Labour Disputes/unfair dismissals  
 ⁃ Law suits/court applications

 • Create a Resource Hub - a place where people can come to to look for direction and guidance. 

 • TELL THESE STORIES - 
We need to get the word out there as to what is happening here in SA 
Weekly blog detailing these events/stories/projects
Report the verified stories - via a newsletter/blog, via short, professional news headline type stories, and longer “news hour” type productions 

 • Help where we can - 
 • collaborate where we can
 • Start small projects of our own with funds available

Medium to long term goals
Use the network to set up
 1. Alternate/parallel health body - where practitioners can practice without restrictions. With a focus on Natural Medicine
 2. Self sustaining “villages” - off the grid, with clean, potable water. Each “village” will network and co-exist with the others
 3. Set up home schooling systems in each village 
 4. Private college buy in


How do we do this ?

 1. Reorganise the structure of Vuka
 2. Keep only the ffg working groups :- Website and SM, Fundraising and Marketing, Media
 3. Convert the existing groups as follow 
        Schools becomes “Education and Outreach”
        Law becomes “Labour Disputes and Court applications”
        Jab Victims Support becomes “Medical stories and support”
        Vuka International becomes “First hand International news”
        Vuka Future SA becomes “Planning ahead”
   4. The existing main group will become “Discussion and Direction” - those that want 
        to remain on the main group will be allowed to share media. Members will source important happenings around South Africa. Verify - then post these. 15% international stories. These stories will be picked up by blog writers and media team. All members will be up to date as to where to direct questions from the public and how to assist groups. Weekly meetings will be held to keep members updated.
