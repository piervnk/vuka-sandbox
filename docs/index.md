## Questions

1. If you get vaccinated, you generate an immune response and your body is instructed to produce spike proteins, which you can then spread around for an indeterminate period. Why are people not being told to stay at home for the two weeks after vaccinnation.
2. If you are 'incapacitated' due to being unvaccinated then workmens compensation must fund you. Is this right?



## Ideas for stories

The COVID-19 crisis will exacerbate maternal and child undernutrition and child mortality in low- and middle-income countries

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a nutritional crisis in LMICs, Without swift and strategic responses by subnational, national, regional and international actors, COVID-19 will not only reverse years of progress and exacerbate disparities in disease, malnutrition and mortality, but will also jeopardize human capital development and economic growth for the next generation25

COVID-19 pandemic leads to greater depth of unaffordability of healthy and nutrient-adequate diets in low- and middle-income countries

Unaffordability of healthy diets affected 3 billion people before the COVID-19 pandemic, 2.5 billion of whom lived in 63 low- and middle-income countries. In these 63 countries, income losses due to the pandemic have markedly worsened the affordability gap. The proportion of people unable to afford half the cost of a healthy diet increased from 43% to 50%; this increased unaffordability will aggravate undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and diet-related non-communicable diseases.
