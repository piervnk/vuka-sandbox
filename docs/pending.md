## Employer responsibilities that workers may not understand.

PART ONE

I have worked in health and safety in the workplace since 2001, over 20 years and what I try to do as a trainer and educator is make complex legal writings as understandable as possible to ordinary workers. I am not a lawyer but did study 5 years of law subjects in my Business Training. What follows will, I hope, bring some clarity as to the legal liability that applies to the CEO of a company or a department of the State.

The Occupational Health and Safety Act [ OHS Act 85 or 1993 – as amended] makes some demands on the CEO of a company in Section 8. CEO refers to the highest decision maker so their title may be different. I will focus on the top demands they have to consider.

1. To ensure a workplace that is safe and free from harm. That means to provide working conditions for all persons under their control as directed by the Constitution. Some ask why is this needed? Certain work activities – tasks you may be asked to perform - can pose risks of causing you health problems or result in a physical injury or even death.
2. The key to the imposed duty above is to perform Risk Assessments. There are several ways to do this but the most effective is to examine the tasks each worker performs and apply risk-based thinking to that task. This is a complex exercise best carried out by suitably trained persons. It has to come to a conclusion that the task has occupational risks attached that could give rise [cause] harm or injury to the workers health or body. Then preventative measures  have to be put in place to stop the harms such as engineering controls [ design], administrative controls [methods of work – procedures on how to work safely], other controls that can work and finally, where we can add personal protective equipment [PPE] and continue to work, this is done. Naturally if none of these can work, we stop that activity in the interests of safety.
3. Inform and train the workers. It is the duty of the CEO to ensure [make it happen] that all risks are identified and that you, the worker know about these risks and what to do about them. That also means that monitoring or checking that the steps taken for safety and health are working as intended.

What this means, in simple terms,  in the current “covid pandemic” context is :-
1. “Vaccination”, if imposed by the employer, become the responsibility of the employer. Should an employee suffer an adverse effect (sustain injury), because of a workplace policy, the employer is liable for medical costs to investigate, treat and compensate said employee.

2 - It is well documented that certain age groups and certain types of vocation pose different risks to illnesses. Sars-Cov2 is no different. Making a blanket policy in a workplace that has employees of differing risks contravenes these acts. Furthermore, the Risk Assessments must be done by an expert in the field and the process and results need to be transparent to all whom the policy affects.

3 - This is similar to “informed consent” that is the right of every individual receiving medical treatment. Mandating a treatment in the workplace, emphasises this and responsibility for full disclosure of all potential benefits and harms becomes the burden of the employer as well as the administrator [person injecting the employees].
