PART ONE

I have worked in health and safety in the workplace since 2001, over 20 years and what I try to do as a trainer and educator is make complex legal writings as understandable as possible to ordinary workers. I am not a lawyer but did study 5 years of law subjects in my Business Training. What follows will, I hope, bring some clarity as to the legal liability that applies to the CEO of a company or a department of the State.

The Occupational Health and Safety Act [ OHS Act 85 or 1993 – as amended] makes some demands on the CEO of a company in Section 8. CEO refers to the highest decision maker so their title may be different. I will focus on the top demands they have to consider.



1. To ensure a workplace that is safe and free from harm. That means to provide working conditions for all persons under their control as directed by the Constitution. Some ask why is this needed? Certain work activities – tasks you may be asked to perform - can pose risks of causing you health problems or result in a physical injury or even death.
2. The key to the imposed duty above is to perform Risk Assessments. There are several ways to do this but the most effective is to examine the tasks each worker performs and apply risk-based thinking to that task. This is a complex exercise best carried out by suitably trained persons. It has to come to a conclusion that the task has occupational risks attached that could give rise [cause] harm or injury to the workers health or body. Then preventative measures  have to be put in place to stop the harms such as engineering controls [ design], administrative controls [methods of work – procedures on how to work safely], other controls that can work and finally, where we can add personal protective equipment [PPE] and continue to work, this is done. Naturally if none of these can work, we stop that activity in the interests of safety.
3. Inform and train the workers. It is the duty of the CEO to ensure [make it happen] that all risks are identified and that you, the worker know about these risks and what to do about them. That also means that monitoring or checking that the steps taken for safety and health are working as intended.

What this means, in simple terms,  in the current “covid pandemic” context is :-
1. “Vaccination”, if imposed by the employer, become the responsibility of the employer. Should an employee suffer an adverse effect (sustain injury), because of a workplace policy, the employer is liable for medical costs to investigate, treat and compensate said employee.

2 - It is well documented that certain age groups and certain types of vocation pose different risks to illnesses. Sars-Cov2 is no different. Making a blanket policy in a workplace that has employees of differing risks contravenes these acts. Furthermore, the Risk Assessments must be done by an expert in the field and the process and results need to be transparent to all whom the policy affects.

3 - This is similar to “informed consent” that is the right of every individual receiving medical treatment. Mandating a treatment in the workplace, emphasises this and responsibility for full disclosure of all potential benefits and harms becomes the burden of the employer as well as the administrator [person injecting the employees].

Employer responsibilities that workers may not understand.

I have worked in health and safety in the workplace since 2001, over 20 years and what I try to do as a trainer and educator is make complex legal writings as understandable as possible to ordinary workers. I am not a lawyer but did study 5 years of law subjects in my Business Training. What follows will, I hope, bring some clarity as to the legal liability that applies to the CEO of a company or a department of the State.
The Occupational Health and Safety Act [ OHS Act 85 or 1993 – as amended] makes some demands on the CEO of a company in Section 8. CEO refers to the highest decision maker so their title may be different. I will focus on the top demands they have to consider.
1 – to ensure a workplace that is safe and free from harm. That means to provide working conditions for all persons under their control as directed by the Constitution. Some ask why is this needed? Certain work activities – tasks you may be asked to perform - can pose risks of causing you health problems or result in a physical injury or even death.
2 – the key to the imposed duty above is to perform Risk Assessments. There are several ways to do this but the most effective is to examine the tasks each worker performs and apply risk-based thinking to that task. This is a complex exercise best carried out by suitably trained persons. It has to come to a conclusion that the task has occupational risks attached that could give rise [ cause] harm or injury to the workers health or body. Then preventative measures  have to be put in place to stop the harms such as engineering controls [ design], administrative controls [ methods of work – procedures on how to work safely], other controls that can work and finally, where we can add personal protective equipment [PPE] and continue to work, this is done. Naturally if none of these can work, we stop that activity in the interests of safety.
3 – Inform and train the workers. It is the duty of the CEO to ensure [ make it happen] that all risks are identified and that you, the worker know about these risks and what to do about them. That also means that monitoring or checking that the steps taken for safety and health are working as intended.

Now I want to show you that the CEO also carries a personal legal liability for duties under the OHS act. Please note that a registered Company is a Juristic Person [ a legal entity in law], however the officers of the company are legal persons who act for the company. The duties in the OHS Act under section 37(1) apply to the persons, specifically the CEO at the top.
It is interesting to note that the wording speaks about acts and omissions.
In simple terms: Acts – a thing you do or did, Omissions – a thing you should have done but did not do.
This also applies to workers but the law starts with the Employer, the CEO. And where something has gone wrong the CEO is first asked 3 key questions:
    a) Was the employee acting without the connivance [influence] or permission of the employer?  So I say: Did the act arise only by an action of the employee that was not authorised or permitted?
    b) Was this act or omission within the scope of authority of the employee? So I say: did the employee know, was informed, was trained, was monitored or supervised, was corrected when observed to deviate, was instructed properly about that scope of authority? Note: The scope of authority has to be reasonable, just, fair and not in conflict with the Constitution or the fundamental rights of the employee.
    c) Were all reasonable steps which could have prevented the act or omission, taken by the Employer ? So I say: here the employer will have to answer whether he or she has complied with section 8 [ see above] of the Act to its Fullest Extent, as well as with other relevant sections of this Act [ including the Regulations].

What does this all really mean? The CEO must have a System in place to ensure he or she is protected properly so that the CEO will not be DEEMED to have committed the act or omission themselves. They can be prosecuted for failure to have discharged these duties in their personal capacity [ cannot say ‘the company’ is at fault] even if it was done or not done by an employee!
Does your CEO actually know their duties and legal obligations as imposed on them by the OHA Act? 
A final point: when considering the acts or omissions that may be laid at the feet of the CEO, the reasonable steps taken will be examined. An in-depth look will be taken into the instruction(s) issued by the CEO, or delegated appointees [managers], to establish whether it was lawful, just, fair and in line with the Constitution and the fundamental rights of the employee.
If you, the employee, knew to do something or not to do it and went ahead anyway, you can be prosecuted in a Court of law. You can’t assume you can push this onto the CEO. In like manner, the CEO cannot issue instructions or fail to issue suitable instructions that resulted in injury, ill health or death, and think they can lay this as an act of ‘human error’ at the feet of the employee. Both will be adjudicated through prosecution and deep examination in a Court of law. Violations of an Act of Parliament are criminal in nature.
Conclusion: Everyone in the workplace needs to respect and consider the needs of a safe and healthy workplace with regard to everyone else, including visitors and contractors. I hope this article has given you, the reader, some insight on this small part of the OHS Act. If you work from home under the ‘direction and control’ of your employer, that may have to be a subject for another day.
